# Flashcard-Generator
Use the command line to cycle through the flashcards.

Open the folder in your terminal and input "node main.js" and a prompt will guide you through the cards.

Basic cards have a question and an answer like traditional flashcards.
Cloze cards will a word blank in a sentence and ask you to fill it in.

It's all quite simple. Enjoy!
